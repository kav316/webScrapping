# WebScrapping
This is a common starter project, while I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with all this information
I thought it would be nice to collect and will just list my main ideas here:
## Stocks
pretty self explantory
## Trends
Seems kind of a branch off the stocks reason but cool enough
## Tnadem with Hardware Projects
I won't have to pay into an api to do the work of fetching certain information when I eventualyl do create
my magic mirror

### additional thoughts and comments

This one I feel pretty committed to seeing through as it does have potential and the only thing that 
makes this a bit unique is that while it is picking up information from stuff, this is quite manaual and ultimately will only really be scrapping once a day, and not even a large amount of data as it will presumably
only capture about the more recent 100 tweets to keep it simple. To those of you that actually read my code
and take notice that it does not stop after a number oftweets and instead of by screen size may say
'well thats not really going to capture 100 tweets' I'm getting there.
