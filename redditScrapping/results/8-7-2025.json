      "Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post in but I was cleaning my house recently and I found a stock that my grandfather purchased in 1944. It is 1 share in Brown County Cooperative Association (a farmers co op in aberdeen sd). I have been trying to find the co op online to see if it is worth anything but when I spoke to the county office they said it had disbanded. Is it worth pursuing this further or should I just give up on it? I can include a picture of the certificate if that would be helpful just not sure what information is relevant."

      "The TACO trade may doom the stock market",
      "Today when Trump announced the 25% tariffs on Japan and Korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction. Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point.",
      "The markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out.",
      "Here’s the thing: Trump always chickens out because of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market.",
      "When the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a very bad thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. He will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits. Then, if earnings start coming in negative and the GDP shrinks, the market could crash again like on April 3rd.",

      "No more comparing Tesla's brand damage issue to Bud Light. This is the equivalent of putting Mulvaney in charge of subsequent clean up job. The thing that amazes me most, is that Elon is completely unaware that the problem is him. He blamed Afshar as if he could have done something more, fired him (and the entire PR departement a while back if you remember), then with his planet sized ego, puts himself in charge of the problem he needlessly created. What does he think he is going to do? Convince all of Europe to see things his way and change their entire culture to suit his whack-a-doodle views? In his mind, are they all going to be doing the elbowless waves to idolize him by the end of Q3?",
      "Simultaneously, he is now trying to take on the entire US government by going after both sides of the aisle. At what point does the market realize Elon has completely lost his mind? He is clearly having some sort of delusions about taking over the world. His cult followers that were the only ones allowed to ride in the staged Robotaxi \"launch\" understood their mission from their leader. Unless you want to hear a 15-minute Tesla pump session, just skip to the 18:00 mark on this video when he gets out:",

      "Transcript: \"I'm feeling pretty bullish. I think I am going to buy the stock. This company is about to take over the world I think...\"",
      "They aren't even being subtle about it anymore. They are just telling people to buy the stock because a few select social media influencers were given highly controlled rides and a clear mission to pump. It all seems so desperate. Elon purchased Twitter to build his influence and I speculate somewhere around 10% of his 221+ million followers have had their brain turned to mush by Grok. That is a lot of people that can pump this meme stock. And they probably do think Elon will take over the world and will put their last pennies into that fantasy. Does anyone think that a staged social media campaign based on pure nonsense is enough to keep this stock in absurd P/E range that it has held in at for such a long time?",
      "At what point is the board of Tesla liable to the shareholders for allowing this sort of behavior to continue? I guess they are all too busy selling their shares as fast as their agreements allow them to. Seriously, does anyone look at the insider trading activity and recent high-level departures of this company as have any doubts as to what is going on inside this rapidly failing company?",

While the administration has touted finalizing agreements soon, trade talks, especially with major partners like the EU, Japan, and India, still seem unresolved",

How these talks evolve could dictate the next moves in the broader market, particularly for trade-sensitive sectors like tech, manufacturing, and agriculture",

Could this change be just noise, or is there a deeper market trend taking shape? Despite the tariff chatter, the stock market, especially the U.S. stock market, could continue to gain momentum as traders move past the noise and focus on the fundamentals",
      "Looking at the technical side, we could see sectors like semiconductors, which are heavily influenced by trade relations, experience more volatility. If Trump’s deadline is delayed, we might see some short-term corrections in those areas"

I'm thinking of trimming my NVDA position down to 200k, increase my AMD position by that same amount. I'm not sure where to invest my remaining 110k in cash. I'm looking for high growth tech companies with market cap of 300M+, positive analyst forecasts, good revenue and EPS growth estimates. It can be large caps too if the PEG ratio is close to 1 or below like TSMC used to be until recently. Looking for stock recommendations as I'm having a hard time finding something that looks undervalued that meets my criteria. I'm currently considering 50K in TSE: AIDX and 20k in TSE: WELL. I'm mostly into real estate but I'm looking to grow my stock portfolio and assume a little bit more risk for growth, as long as the risk/reward makes sense, not looking to gamble on meme stocks."

He will not have anything like a clear plan and will not have any countries willing to sign on with him. At that point, the trade-policy gobbledygook will suddenly evaporate and we will have a much clearer view of the the threats to our economy, these including: inflation, rises in cost of living, unemployment, uncertainty and apprehension about the future, etc.",

I'd assume the market already priced in the current 10% so why would markets be dipping on that if it stays 10% for all on July 9? I'm not sure what to make of this, seems like misdirection."

      "6 days ago",
      "The private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, badly missing expectations for a 100,000 increase, ADP says",
      "Private sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy that investors believe as they bid the S&P 500 back up to record territory to end the month.",
      "Private payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in the June, the ADP report showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000.",
      "“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a press release published Wednesday morning.",
      "To be sure, the ADP report has a spotty track record on predicting the subsequent government jobs report, which investors tend to weigh more heavily. May’s soft ADP data ended up differing significantly from the monthly jobs report figures that came later in the week.",
      "This week, the government’s nonfarm payrolls report will be out on Thursday with economists expecting a healthy 110,000 increase for June, per Dow Jones estimates. Economists are expecting the unemployment rate to tick higher to 4.3% from 4.2%. Some economists could revise down their jobs reports estimates following ADP’s data.",
      "Weekly jobless claims data is also due Thursday, with economists penciling in 240,000. This string of labor stats comes during a shortened trading week, with the market closing early on Thursday and remaining dark on Friday in honor of the July 4 holiday.",
      "Service roles hit hardest",
      "The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to the ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000.",
      "Financial activity roles also contributed to this month’s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance.",
      "But the contraction was capped by payroll expansions in goods-producing roles across industries such as manufacturing and mining. All together, goods-producing positions grew by 32,000 in the month, while payrolls for service roles overall fell by 66,000.",
      "The Midwest and Western U.S. saw the strongest contractions in June, declining by 24,000 and 20,000, respectively. Meanwhile, the Northeast shed 3,000 roles. The Southern U.S. was the sole region tracked by the ADP to see payrolls expand on net in the month, recording an increase of 13,000 positions.",
      "The smallest firms tended to see more job losses this month than their larger counterparts. In fact, businesses with more than 500 employees saw the biggest payroll growth in the month with an increase of 30,000, per the ADP. By comparison, businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for 29,000 lost roles on net.",
      "Annualized income growth decreased modestly from May for both job stayers and hoppers. The rate of pay increase for those staying in their jobs ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, while those getting new roles slid to 6.8% from 7%.",
      "Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html",
      "My thoughts: Labor data significantly influences Fed policy (of course they might revise this later down the road) which leads to rate changes, market adjusts as a result of those rate changes, and affects volatility as a result, etc etc. So... rate cuts became a lot more likely."

The tariffs caused significant market disruption, leading many investors, even experienced ones, to sell off their holdings. This panic was evident across various online forums, including this one.",
      "While a small number of individuals advocated for maintaining steady investment practices and avoiding panic, the overwhelming majority expressed extremely pessimistic views, with some even predicting an economic apocalypse. Many urged investors to pull their money out of the market, claiming this was an unprecedented economic event. There was also a strong push to invest in European and emerging markets instead.",
      "Looking back, these dire predictions proved to be false. Investors who adhered to established investment principles successfully navigated the turbulence, and those who capitalized on the widespread fear by buying during the downturn have since seen substantial returns. The U.S. markets have experienced a significant surge recently, fueled by positive developments in new trade deals.",
      "This period serves as a reminder about the perils of groupthink and the absence of diverse perspectives in online communities. Too often, biases, mob mentality, and political sentiments unduly influence investment decisions. It's important to learn from this experience: actively seek out dissenting opinions and fortify your investment strategy against fear, groupthink, and short-term market events.",

      "Big beautiful Bill , Medicare and Medicaid cuts and Healthcare REITs",
      "Industry News",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed on July 1, 2025, is the biggest cut to U.S. healthcare funding in years. It reduces Medicaid by $793 billion over 10 years, changes the ACA, trims Medicare, and puts more pressure on hospitals, nursing homes, and senior care, all of which affect healthcare real estate stocks.",
      "With the new cuts and tougher rules, about 7 to 8 million people could lose Medicaid, and up to 17 million total could lose health insurance by 2034. Many will end up in emergency rooms for basic care, raising unpaid hospital bills and hurting local budgets.",
      "Medicare will shrink by about $2 trillion, pushing more seniors into private Medicare Advantage plans that can cost more. Some seniors get a small tax break but will still face higher costs for care.",
      "Nursing homes and assisted living centers will get less money from states. New rules mean they must hire more staff, which costs more. Many may have to downsize or close if they can’t cover these extra costs.",
      "Rural hospitals and safety-net hospitals will see more uninsured patients and more unpaid bills. Some may shut down, putting patients at risk in small towns and poor areas.",
      "This may hurt healthcare real estate companies too. Big healthcare REITs like Welltower (WELL), Ventas (VTR), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK), Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI), Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA), LTC Properties (LTC), Medical Properties Trust (MPW), Physicians Realty Trust (DOC), Universal Health Realty Income Trust (UHT), and Community Healthcare Trust (CHCT) may get a tax break because the bill raises the real estate pass-through deduction from 20% to 23%. But if hospitals, nursing homes, or senior housing close or lose money, these REITs could have empty buildings or tenants who can’t pay rent. Senior and Adults children ( children of adults) will feel the heat in their pockets.",
      "In short, this law will cut healthcare for millions and make hospitals and nursing homes struggle, especially in rural areas. The REITs above might save on taxes for now but face risks if their tenants can’t survive the funding cuts. Investors should watch for more closures, lower rent payments, and weaker property values in this sector for years to come.",
      "Expect lot of rebalancing and redirection of flow of fund within healthcare REITs in the next few days."

If it jumps to the upside and starts to fall sharply, especially if it breaks below VWAP early and can't get back up, I'll probably buy some puts or bear spreads targeting a pullback to the $145 area, where there's been support",
      "I won't lie, this stuff feels frothy. the RSI index is quite stretched and has risen vertically with little to no consolidation. Nonetheless, the AI hype is still very real and a lot of institutional money is still pouring in. As such, I'm not going to call a top, just react to the price action.If semiconductors or large tech stocks fall, I would also look at QQQ and IONQ, NVDA may not be able to stand alone"

      "There are a few schools of thought here that say USD has devalued and hence stocks are increasing in value and then the second being the continuous influx of liquidity through 401k and other DCA contributions that is keeping the market floating (or rising in our case). Let's break this down",
      "1) The quarterly rate of 401k and other retirement contributions has not changed by a lot - still at the 12-14% rate of income in the latest quarter too. Here is the thing - this has been consistent for years and people are missing the point that all recent and previous crashes and rallies continued to happen irrespective of this constant flow of money - So stop imagining that this 401K money is keeping market up - market is and has always moved disproportionate to this influx of 401k / DCA money and there are larger players that impact the trend.",
      "2) USD devaluation - yes USD is devaluing - example USD - EUR has dropped 10+% vs SPY is literally flat YTD (even after the big liberation week drop and post rally). This just means that SPY is 10% cheaper in the international market and still has room to grow in USD denomination markets (i.e. US Markets). The only way the market rally breaks is if USD stabilizes making US stocks more expensive. This has been a change in my thought recently.",
