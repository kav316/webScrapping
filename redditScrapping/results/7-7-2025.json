  "Can someone ELI5 how the S&P500 can keep an average 10% growth rate for another 30+ years?\nu/Ragnaroknight\n•\n9 hr. ago\nCan someone ELI5 how the S&P500 can keep an average 10% growth rate for another 30+ years?\nIndustry Question\n\nThe total market capitalization of the S&P500 is $52 trillion, if my math is right this means it would double to over $100trillion in 7ish years, and by the end of 30 years be approaching almost $1quadrillion in value ($900 trillion)? \n\nThat sounds really stupid and impossible to me. Plus with the birth rate is in constant decline, market growth is only going to slow as less consumers enter the market than before. Which tells me in the future there will be less and less new mega corporations and all the wealth will continue to consolidate into a few huge companies. \n\nThe only thing that makes sense is that more and more multi-trillion dollar companies like Microsoft and Apple start entering the S&P500, to the point where almost every company is worth trillions or close to it. Which also sounds really stupid. \n\nWhere is all this money going to come from? Even if we assume inflation wipes out half of that $900trillion in growth of the S&P500 in today's money, that's still like a ridiculous increase that makes no sense.",
  "The TACO trade may doom the stock market\nu/Top_Abbreviations838\n•\n7 hr. ago\nThe TACO trade may doom the stock market\n\nToday when Trump announced the 25% tariffs on Japan and Korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction. Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. \n\nThe markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. \n\nHere’s the thing: Trump always chickens out because of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. \n\nWhen the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a very bad thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. He will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits. Then, if earnings start coming in negative and the GDP shrinks, the market could crash again like on April 3rd. \n\nEdit: Not a bear. I own positions in VOO and SCHD.",

This is the equivalent of putting Mulvaney in charge of subsequent clean up job. The thing that amazes me most, is that Elon is completely unaware that the problem is him. He blamed Afshar as if he could have done something more, fired him (and the entire PR departement a while back if you remember), then with his planet sized ego, puts himself in charge of the problem he needlessly created. What does he think he is going to do? Convince all of Europe to see things his way and change their entire culture to suit his whack-a-doodle views? In his mind, are they all going to be doing the elbowless waves to idolize him by the end of Q3? \n\nSimultaneously, he is now trying to take on the entire US government by going after both sides of the aisle. At what point does the market realize Elon has completely lost his mind? He is clearly having some sort of delusions about taking over the world. His cult followers that were the only ones allowed to ride in the staged Robotaxi \"launch\" understood their mission from their leader. Unless you want to hear a 15-minute Tesla pump session, just skip to the 18:00 mark on this video when he gets out: \n\n(can't post YouTube vids, but see \"I SURVIVED A TESLA ROBOTAXI RIDE (BARELY)\") \n\nTranscript: \"I'm feeling pretty bullish. I think I am going to buy the stock. This company is about to take over the world I think...\" \n\nThey aren't even being subtle about it anymore. They are just telling people to buy the stock because a few select social media influencers were given highly controlled rides and a clear mission to pump. It all seems so desperate. Elon purchased Twitter to build his influence and I speculate somewhere around 10% of his 221+ million followers have had their brain turned to mush by Grok. That is a lot of people that can pump this meme stock. And they probably do think Elon will take over the world and will put their last pennies into that fantasy. Does anyone think that a staged social media campaign based on pure nonsense is enough to keep this stock in absurd P/E range that it has held in at for such a long time? \n\nAt what point is the board of Tesla liable to the shareholders for allowing this sort of behavior to continue? I guess they are all too busy selling their shares as fast as their agreements allow them to. Seriously, does anyone look at the insider trading activity and recent high-level departures of this company as have any doubts as to what is going on inside this rapidly failing company? \n\n*I hold TSLZ right now.

While the administration has touted finalizing agreements soon, trade talks, especially with major partners like the EU, Japan, and India, still seem unresolved \n\nDeadline Shift: Trump’s team previously set a July 9 deadline, but with continued negotiations and open-ended remarks, the new \"real\" date seems to be August 1. That’s when tariffs are expected to kick in, unless further deals are reached \n\nTrade Deals in the Air: While some agreements with countries like Vietnam and the UK are in the pipeline, much bigger players are still in limbo. How these talks evolve could dictate the next moves in the broader market, particularly for trade-sensitive sectors like tech, manufacturing, and agriculture \n\nRecently, the market's reaction to tariff-related news has been relatively muted. Stocks have been rallying even as uncertainty looms. Could this change be just noise, or is there a deeper market trend taking shape? Despite the tariff chatter, the stock market, especially the U.S. stock market, could continue to gain momentum as traders move past the noise and focus on the fundamentals \n\nLooking at the technical side, we could see sectors like semiconductors, which are heavily influenced by trade relations, experience more volatility.

  "Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally?\nu/FFVIIGuru\n•\n9 hr. ago\nWill Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally?\nIndustry Discussion\n\nTrump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye. \n\nThe Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed. \n\nLetters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions. \n\nThe timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September. \n\nWhat I think the impact will be: \n\nEasing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound \n\nHistorically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last. \n\nPossible Dollar Weakness? \n\nIf the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters. \n\nMy view: \n\nI think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy. \n\nIf the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains. \n\nWhat I'm watching: \n\nNVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment \n\nXLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports \n\nAAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation \n\nWelcome to the discussion: \n\nDo you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election? \n\nIs it a “bull trap” waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?",

  "Big beautiful Bill , Medicare and Medicaid cuts and Healthcare REITs\nu/azavio\n•\n6 days ago\nBig beautiful Bill , Medicare and Medicaid cuts and Healthcare REITs\nIndustry News\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed on July 1, 2025, is the biggest cut to U.S. healthcare funding in years. It reduces Medicaid by $793 billion over 10 years, changes the ACA, trims Medicare, and puts more pressure on hospitals, nursing homes, and senior care, all of which affect healthcare real estate stocks. \n\nWith the new cuts and tougher rules, about 7 to 8 million people could lose Medicaid, and up to 17 million total could lose health insurance by 2034. Many will end up in emergency rooms for basic care, raising unpaid hospital bills and hurting local budgets. \n\nMedicare will shrink by about $2 trillion, pushing more seniors into private Medicare Advantage plans that can cost more. Some seniors get a small tax break but will still face higher costs for care. \n\nNursing homes and assisted living centers will get less money from states. New rules mean they must hire more staff, which costs more. Many may have to downsize or close if they can’t cover these extra costs. \n\nRural hospitals and safety-net hospitals will see more uninsured patients and more unpaid bills. Some may shut down, putting patients at risk in small towns and poor areas. \n\nThis may hurt healthcare real estate companies too. Big healthcare REITs like Welltower (WELL), Ventas (VTR), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK), Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI), Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA), LTC Properties (LTC), Medical Properties Trust (MPW), Physicians Realty Trust (DOC), Universal Health Realty Income Trust (UHT), and Community Healthcare Trust (CHCT) may get a tax break because the bill raises the real estate pass-through deduction from 20% to 23%. But if hospitals, nursing homes, or senior housing close or lose money, these REITs could have empty buildings or tenants who can’t pay rent. Senior and Adults children ( children of adults) will feel the heat in their pockets. \n\nIn short, this law will cut healthcare for millions and make hospitals and nursing homes struggle, especially in rural areas. The REITs above might save on taxes for now but face risks if their tenants can’t survive the funding cuts. Investors should watch for more closures, lower rent payments, and weaker property values in this sector for years to come. \n\nExpect lot of rebalancing and redirection of flow of fund within healthcare REITs in the next few days.",

So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent told CNN's \"State of Union.\" \n\nAAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names. \n\nBessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Wall Street is waiting to see how trade talks between the European Union and Canada go, in addition to other key partners.",
  "Trump Takes Aim at Musk Over EV Subsidies; Tesla Shares Slump\nu/cxr_cxr2\n•\n7 days ago\nTrump Takes Aim at Musk Over EV Subsidies; Tesla Shares Slump\nCompany News\n\nBloomberg) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at Elon Musk on Tuesday, accusing the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer of benefiting excessively from government electric vehicle subsidies. Tesla shares tumbled. \n\n“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. \n\n“No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!,” he added. \n\nThis comes after Musk slammed the US Senate’s latest version of Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax bill, warning that the cuts to EV and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country. Tesla shares slumped 5.8% in European premarket trading on Tradegate. \n\nTesla has benefitted from a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles that Trump’s bill will eliminate. The automaker is set to release second-quarter sales later this week that will likely show a further slump in demand. \n\n“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” Trump said. “It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.”",

Any thoughts would be welcome!\nu/Kalepa2\n•\n1 day ago\nCould leveraged ETFs make much money on July 9 when Trump's deadline expires and he wants to raise tariffs? Any thoughts would be welcome!\n\nMy general thesis is that on July 9, the Stock Market may crash because that's when the foolishness of Trump's trade tariffs will be made clear when his 90 Day Tariffs end on that day. He will not have anything like a clear plan and will not have any countries willing to sign on with him. At that point, the trade-policy gobbledygook will suddenly evaporate and we will have a much clearer view of the the threats to our economy, these including: inflation, rises in cost of living, unemployment, uncertainty and apprehension about the future, etc. \n\nTrump has been making a lot of money for himself and his friends with suddenly raising and lowering tariffs, but he makes money as much of the country loses money. \n\nAlso, he is cheating, breaking the law as he engages in his tariff manipulation and should be punished in some way. \n\nI'd welcome any thoughts on this.

  "What Would a NAPS Portfolio Look Like in the U.S.?\nu/Synfinium\n•\n1 day ago\nWhat Would a NAPS Portfolio Look Like in the U.S.?\n\nFor those unfamiliar, NAPS stands for No-Admin Portfolio System, and it’s a popular UK-based investing strategy developed by Stockopedia. The idea is simple: create a low-maintenance, rules-based stock portfolio designed to beat the market without constant oversight.\n\nWhat is NAPS?\n\nAt its core, NAPS is built using StockRanks, a composite score that ranks stocks based on Quality, Value, and Momentum (QVM). You:\n\nSelect the two highest-ranked stocks in each of the ten major sectors\n\nEqual-weight them in the portfolio\n\nHold for one year\n\nRebalance annually based on updated rankings\n\nIt is fully systematic and intentionally avoids subjective decision-making. No news-based trades, no earnings reactions, no macro predictions.\n\nA Track Record of Outperformance\n\nNAPS has quietly outperformed many professional fund managers and the FTSE All-Share over the past decade in the UK. Its success comes from combining factor-based investing with sector diversification and sticking to it.\n\nWhat If You Ran It in the U.S.?\n\nThis got me thinking: what would a U.S.-based NAPS portfolio look like if you applied the same rules to the U.S. stock market? Using something like Stockopedia’s U.S. coverage or a similar QVM screening method (like Portfolio123 or Finbox), you could replicate the structure:\n\nTen sectors\n\nTwo top-ranked stocks per sector\n\nRebalance once a year\n\nSet it and forget it\n\nThe question is: which 20 stocks would make the list right now?",

No more global trade currency.\nBroad market news\n\nThe Big Beautiful Bill will make the US a riskier investment for foreign governments holding assets traded with dollars, this increases our risk of no longer being the reserve currency of the world and has the potential to cause fallout if we don't have an economic boom to justify spending. \n\nThe US credit rating was downgraded to Aa1 by Moody's in 2023 citing inability to control debt and interest payments, aswell as the potential for the 2017 TCJA tax cuts extentions to add more deficit to debt. Other credit rating agencies have been downgrading the US aswell since 2011. \n\nWith the permanent installation of the TCJA tax cuts into law and the many other deficit adding line items in the BBB, doesn't this point to the US becoming riskier and increase our chance we stop being the world trade reserve currency?

Crypto treasury stocks such as mstr have been top performers. I believe sbet will join this list of top performing crypto treasury companies. \n\nThe difference being that it holds eth. Sbet (SharpLink Gaming) main objective is to get you as much eth per share as possible. When the strategy for acquiring eth was announced the price immediately went from single digits to over 100 dollars per share, and preceded to collapse based on misunderstanding in s3 filing. \n\nContext: \n\nSBET announced a $425 million private placement on May 27, 2025, selling ~69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to prominent crypto investors, including Consensys, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital. The proceeds were used to acquire 176,270.69 ETH at an average price of $2,626, valued at ~$462.9 million, positioning SBET as the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder. \n\nHeres my top 8 reasons for v shaped recovery on the ticker back to new highs:\n\nMisunderstood S-3 Filing and V-Shaped Recovery: The 73% stock crash on June 12, 2025, was due to a misinterpreted S-3 filing mistaken for immediate share dumping, but Joseph Lubin clarified it’s routine, setting SBET up for a quick rebound as seen in its rise to $13.2 by July 3.\n\nMassive Ethereum Treasury: SBET’s 198,167 ETH (~$528.8 million) makes it a strong Ethereum investment, with potential for big gains if ETH price appreciates.\n\nStrong Crypto Backing: Led by Ethereum’s Joseph Lubin (co founder of eth) and backed by Consensys and Pantera Capital, SBET has credible support driving investor interest.\n\nNasdaq Compliance and Resilience: SBET regained Nasdaq compliance, reducing risks, and oversold signals suggest a potential 52% price jump soon.\n\nStaking and creative ways to finance eth purchases: Staking yield is one wise strategy for generating more eth per share. Others include selling common stock when stock price is elevated, issuing convertible notes, and def operations for lending or liquidity pools, creating higher yields than holding ETH alone.\n\nRound 50% (estimate from coin gecko report) of all stable coins lives on Eth with stable coins growth projected to 10x in the next 5 years. Look at circle and genius act. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported this act, and adoption of stable coins. This can be the next catalyst that drives eth price appreciation. (NFTs were major driver for eth in 2021 and has since faded but stable coin adoption is institutional which makes it lot more stable)\n\nInstitutional adoption of stable coins will spark institutional acquisition of eth to help it stabilize the network.\n\nClean financials.

Oil prices were expected to significantly soar during the short US/Israel vs Iran conflict, but they spiked far lower than anyone thought for now, may be to test some resistance and to adjust to the recent Opec cartel production boost.

Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced. \n\nThe House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions. \n\nOver the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage. \n\nIn the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year. \n\nRead More: https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tax-bill-house-pass-9e230859",

The US president has imposed tariffs on almost all its trading partners, saying he wanted to bring back domestic manufacturing, needed to pay for a tax-cut extension and stop other countries from taking advantage of the US. \n\nUS and EU officials will keep negotiating over the weekend, the people said. A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nAny deal ultimately rests on Trump and expected scenarios for next week include an agreement in principle that keeps new tariffs from being introduced; a deal that sees new tariffs come into force until a more formal accord is reached; or the US announcing unilateral tariffs, according to the people. \n\nThe commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, has not endorsed any so-called offsetting mechanism for cars, according to the people. EU officials worry such a move would divert production and investments away from Europe. \n\nThe people cautioned that discussions remained difficult and member states had different views on the level of imbalance they’re prepared to accept in any deal. \n\nSome capitals have said they want a quick agreement and don’t want to escalate, while others want to negotiate from a position of strength by responding to Trump’s levies with countermeasures. \n\nThe bloc is willing to accept some asymmetry in an agreement and a 10% rate on many exports, Bloomberg previously reported. But it continues to want an upfront commitment toward lower rates than that on key sectors such as aviation. \n\n“We want a negotiated solution, but you will know that at the same time we are preparing for the possibility no satisfactory agreement is reached,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. “We will defend the European interest as needed - in other words all the instruments are on the table.” \n\nThe EU has approved tariffs on €21 billion of US goods that can be quickly implemented in response to Trump’s metals levies. They target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as agricultural products, poultry, and motorcycles. \n\nThe bloc has also prepared an additional list of tariffs on €95 billion of American products in response to Trump’s so-called reciprocal levies and automotive duties. They would target industrial goods including Boeing Co. aircraft, US-made cars, and bourbon. The EU is also consulting member states to identify strategic areas where the US relies on the bloc, as well as potential measures that go beyond tariffs such as export controls and restrictions on procurement contracts. \n\nLink: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/carmakers-seek-to-offset-tariffs-as-eu-us-trade-talks-near-end?srnd=homepage-americas",

More likely, autonomy becomes a commodity layer like smartphone OS or GPS chips where value shifts to branding, logistics, and vertical integration. \n\nEven if Waymo has the best tech, that doesn’t guarantee market control.

  "The private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, badly missing expectations for a 100,000 increase, ADP says\nu/WinningWatchlist\n•\n6 days ago\nThe private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, badly missing expectations for a 100,000 increase, ADP says\n\nPrivate sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy that investors believe as they bid the S&P 500 back up to record territory to end the month. \n\nPrivate payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in the June, the ADP report showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000. \n\n“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a press release published Wednesday morning. \n\nTo be sure, the ADP report has a spotty track record on predicting the subsequent government jobs report, which investors tend to weigh more heavily. May’s soft ADP data ended up differing significantly from the monthly jobs report figures that came later in the week. \n\nThis week, the government’s nonfarm payrolls report will be out on Thursday with economists expecting a healthy 110,000 increase for June, per Dow Jones estimates. Economists are expecting the unemployment rate to tick higher to 4.3% from 4.2%. Some economists could revise down their jobs reports estimates following ADP’s data. \n\nWeekly jobless claims data is also due Thursday, with economists penciling in 240,000. This string of labor stats comes during a shortened trading week, with the market closing early on Thursday and remaining dark on Friday in honor of the July 4 holiday. \n\nService roles hit hardest \n\nThe bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to the ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000. \n\nFinancial activity roles also contributed to this month’s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance. \n\nBut the contraction was capped by payroll expansions in goods-producing roles across industries such as manufacturing and mining. All together, goods-producing positions grew by 32,000 in the month, while payrolls for service roles overall fell by 66,000. \n\nThe Midwest and Western U.S. saw the strongest contractions in June, declining by 24,000 and 20,000, respectively. Meanwhile, the Northeast shed 3,000 roles. The Southern U.S. was the sole region tracked by the ADP to see payrolls expand on net in the month, recording an increase of 13,000 positions. \n\nThe smallest firms tended to see more job losses this month than their larger counterparts. In fact, businesses with more than 500 employees saw the biggest payroll growth in the month with an increase of 30,000, per the ADP. By comparison, businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for 29,000 lost roles on net. \n\nAnnualized income growth decreased modestly from May for both job stayers and hoppers. The rate of pay increase for those staying in their jobs ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, while those getting new roles slid to 6.8% from 7%. \n\nLink: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html \n\nMy thoughts: Labor data significantly influences Fed policy (of course they might revise this later down the road) which leads to rate changes, market adjusts as a result of those rate changes, and affects volatility as a result, etc etc. So... rate cuts became a lot more likely.",

The tariffs caused significant market disruption, leading many investors, even experienced ones, to sell off their holdings. This panic was evident across various online forums, including this one. \n\nWhile a small number of individuals advocated for maintaining steady investment practices and avoiding panic, the overwhelming majority expressed extremely pessimistic views, with some even predicting an economic apocalypse. Many urged investors to pull their money out of the market, claiming this was an unprecedented economic event. There was also a strong push to invest in European and emerging markets instead. \n\nLooking back, these dire predictions proved to be false. Investors who adhered to established investment principles successfully navigated the turbulence, and those who capitalized on the widespread fear by buying during the downturn have since seen substantial returns. The U.S. markets have experienced a significant surge recently, fueled by positive developments in new trade deals. \n\nThis period serves as a reminder about the perils of groupthink and the absence of diverse perspectives in online communities. Too often, biases, mob mentality, and political sentiments unduly influence investment decisions. It's important to learn from this experience: actively seek out dissenting opinions and fortify your investment strategy against fear, groupthink, and short-term market events. \n\nSticking to tried-and-true investment methods remains paramount.",

  "MBLY: We Are Watching a Short Squeeze Unfold in Real Time – And Puts Are Getting Obliterated\nu/upunup\n•\n4 days ago\nMBLY: We Are Watching a Short Squeeze Unfold in Real Time – And Puts Are Getting Obliterated\nRule 3: Low Effort\n\nFor market participants closely monitoring the dynamics of heavily shorted equities, Mobileye Global (MBLY) is currently presenting a compelling live case study of a short squeeze in progress. MBLY has long been a target for short sellers, with approximately 23.6% of its float held in short positions as of the latest data. This substantial short interest establishes the perfect conditions for a squeeze. As the stock price rises unexpectedly, short sellers, who borrowed shares to sell, are increasingly pressured to buy them back to cover their positions and limit mounting losses. This forced buying fuels further upward price momentum, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates the squeeze. \n\nSince April 21, 2025, when MBLY shares traded at $11.58, the stock has experienced a dramatic ascent, yesterday, July 2nd, trading at up to $19.38. This remarkable 67% surge in just over two months is creating significant pain for short sellers. \n\nWhat adds a layer of complexity and heightened risk to this MBLY scenario is the behavior of its options market. Despite the aggressive upward price movement in the underlying stock, the implied volatility (IV) in MBLY options has remained notably subdued, often registering in the 25-34th percentile. This suggests that the options market, prior to and even during parts of this rally, has not fully priced in the true extent of the stock's potential for sharp movements. \n\nFurther exacerbating this is the general illiquidity prevalent in MBLY's options contracts. In such an environment, large orders can have a disproportionate impact on prices, and it becomes challenging for market participants to enter or exit positions efficiently. Bid-ask spreads can widen, and the ability to find a counterparty quickly is diminished. \n\nThis combination of low IV and illiquidity has created a dangerous trap, particularly for naked call sellers. Naked call selling involves writing (selling) call options without owning the underlying shares. While this strategy offers upfront premium income, its risk profile is theoretically unlimited if the stock price rises significantly above the strike price. Traders who sold naked calls on MBLY, potentially misjudging the stock's volatility due to its low IV or underestimating the potential for a short squeeze, are now finding themselves deeply underwater. The rapid surge in MBLY's share price means these calls are now significantly in-the-money, forcing sellers into a desperate situation where they must either buy back the highly appreciated calls or acquire the underlying shares at inflated prices to fulfill their obligations. The illiquid options market makes their exit even more painful and costly. \n\nMoreover, it appears that significant amounts of put options were purchased, likely by investors or traders betting on a decline in MBLY's price. Given the substantial rally, it is highly probable that a considerable portion of these purchased put options are now deep out-of-the-money (OTM) and are set to expire worthless. This represents another cohort of market participants incurring losses, as the premiums paid for these puts will be forfeited. This also contributes to the overall market dynamics, as put sellers (who benefited from the stock's rise) now face no obligation to buy shares at lower strike prices. \n\nWhile the short squeeze mechanics are undeniable, it's also important to acknowledge broader factors that may be contributing to Mobileye's upward momentum. Easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, hints of potential interest rate cuts by central banks, and positive news regarding strategic partnerships (such as reported collaborations for robotaxi services utilizing Mobileye's technology) are all providing a constructive backdrop for the company. \n\nThe ongoing MBLY saga serves as a timely reminder of the potent forces at play in financial markets – particularly the confluence of high short interest, market sentiment, and the often-unforeseen consequences within the options trading landscape. \n\nhttps://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MBLY/short-interest/",

  "Two situations that you need to understand - USD devaluation and Liquidity\nu/notyourregularninja\n•\n7 days ago\nTwo situations that you need to understand - USD devaluation and Liquidity\nCrystal Ball Post\n\nThere are a few schools of thought here that say USD has devalued and hence stocks are increasing in value and then the second being the continuous influx of liquidity through 401k and other DCA contributions that is keeping the market floating (or rising in our case). Let's break this down \n\n1) The quarterly rate of 401k and other retirement contributions has not changed by a lot - still at the 12-14% rate of income in the latest quarter too. Here is the thing - this has been consistent for years and people are missing the point that all recent and previous crashes and rallies continued to happen irrespective of this constant flow of money - So stop imagining that this 401K money is keeping market up - market is and has always moved disproportionate to this influx of 401k / DCA money and there are larger players that impact the trend. \n\n2) USD devaluation - yes USD is devaluing - example USD - EUR has dropped 10+% vs SPY is literally flat YTD (even after the big liberation week drop and post rally). This just means that SPY is 10% cheaper in the international market and still has room to grow in USD denomination markets (i.e. US Markets). The only way the market rally breaks is if USD stabilizes making US stocks more expensive. This has been a change in my thought recently. \n\nPositions: Just bought SPY calls for 650 expiring Dec 2026 - rationale - expecting continued momentum and then a sharp drop - expecting to sell before the sharp drop (yes catching the dropping knife sometimes before September).",
